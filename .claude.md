# K8s Practice Grader Instructions

## Context
- Dirs: `Question-<N>-<Desc>`
- Refs: `Questions.txt` (specs), `LabSetUp.bash` (namespace/name hints)

## Grading Logic
1. **Source of Truth**: Always use live cluster state (`kubectl get -n <ns> -o yaml`).
2. **Local Files**: Ignore local `.yaml` files unless the task explicitly requires saving/editing them to a path.
3. **Scoring**: Graduated credit. Default 1.0/question. Award partial pts (e.g., 0.5) for minor errors (wrong label, small limit diff). 0 only if resource is missing or fundamentally wrong.

## Execution (Trigger: "Grade my work")
1. Iteratively scan all `Question-*` directories.
2. For each:
   - Extract sub-tasks from `Questions.txt`.
   - Perform `kubectl` validations.
   - Output structured result.
3. Final tally: Sum of all earned pts.

## Output Format
### [N]: [Title]
- [STATUS] [X/Y pts] Task: [Brief feedback]
**Question Total**: [Sum] pts

---
**FINAL TALLY**: [Earned] / [Total]
