Question
You're working in a kubernetes cluster with an existing deployment named busybox-logger running
in the q7-priority namespace.
The cluster already has at least one user defined Priority Class (q7-user-critical)

Tasks:
1. Create a new Priority Class named high-priority for user workloads. The value of this class should
be exactly one less than the highest existing user-defined priority class (q7-user-critical)
2. Patch the existing deployment busybox-logger in the q7-priority namespace to use the newly created high-priority class
