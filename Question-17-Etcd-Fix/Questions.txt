Question:
After a cluster migration, the controlplane kube-apiserver is not coming up
Before the migration, the etcd was external and in HA, after migration the kube-api server was pointing to etcd peer port 2380


The kube-scheduler static pod is also not starting. Troubleshoot and fix this to restore the cluster to a working state.

Hint: The CPU request should not exceed 10% of the node capacity.


Task
Fix it
(After fixing, please run bash ./Revert.bash to restore the cluster for other labs if needed)
