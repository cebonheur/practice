Question:
A user accidentally deleted the MariaDB Deployment in the q1-mariadb namespace. The deployment
was configured with persistent storage. Your responsibility is to re-establish the deployment
while ensuring data is preserved by reusing the available PersistentVolume

Task
A PersistentVolume already exists (q1-mariadb-pv) and is retained for reuse.
Create a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) named mariadb in the q1-mariadb namespace with the spec
Access Mode = ReadWriteOnce
Storage = 250Mi
Edit the MariaDb Deployment file located at ~/questions/q1/mariadb-deploy.yaml to use the PVC created in the previous step
Apply the updated Deployment file to the cluster
Ensure the MariaDB Deployment is running and Stable
